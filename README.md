## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Michael, I am a full-stack engineer working for Akamai. I am constantly learning and exploring this new world of creating things. Until a few years ago I had made a career in firefighting - with the increase in inflation I simply wasn't able to keep afloat. Eventually I was given an awesome opportunity to fill a Software Engineering role, which has opened doors I never thought possibe. I still get to help people, just in a totally new way :)!

- ðŸ”­ I am currently working on: Home-School, an application for homsechooling families to track their education.
     In addition I have some other projects I am in the design stages of.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: Rust, Golang, and C and trying to become more proficient in the languages I already know.
     always learning! :)

  * I have five kids.
  * I am a self taught developer!
  * As a wildland Firefighter I worked on engines, a specialized handcrew, and a helicopter crew

**Operating Systems**

I have a broad experience professionally with all major operating systems (excluding the BSD ecosystem). I have worked with Linux, MacOS, and Windows in private and professional settings. That being said, I am happiest with a Linux system. All of my home systems are running Arch with the exception of my Proxmox server which is used to quickly spin up networking and homelab LXCs.
