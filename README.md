## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Michael, I am a full-stack engineer working for Akamai. I am constantly learning and exploring this new world of creating things. Until a few years ago I had made a career in firefighting - with the increase in inflation I simply wasn't able to keep afloat. Eventually I was given an awesome opportunity to fill a Software Engineering role, which has opened doors I never thought possibe. I still get to help people, just in a totally new way :)!

- ðŸ”­ I am currently working on: Home-School, an application for homsechooling families to track their education.
     In addition I have some other projects I am in the design stages of.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: Rust, C++, and trying to become more proficient in the languages I already know,
     always learning! :)
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m always open to helping with open source projects. Particularly interested in work with computer vision, UAS/UAVs, and embedded systems. Reach out if you need help!
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: [My Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-braley/)
- âš¡ Fun facts:
  * I have five kids.
  * I am a self taught developer!
  * As a wildland Firefighter I worked on engines, a specialized handcrew, and a helicopter crew

**Operating Systems**

![Linux](https://img.shields.io/badge/Linux-FCC624?style=for-the-badge&logo=linux&logoColor=black)

Linux is my primary operating system of choice. I run Arch based systems, or Debian derivitives. I have Windows on one system due to some things that don't work in Proton yet. My work machine runs MacOS -> I like it about as much as windows.
